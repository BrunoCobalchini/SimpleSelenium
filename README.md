# *How To*

Hello, before start make sure that you have Chrome driver installed and configurated in your Variable Enviroment, in my case it's on "C:\\ChromeDriver\chromedriver.exe".Thank you!

# Let's start!
1. Theres a class called FillFields(on com.selenium.pageObject).This will be the location to run the application
2. I have not used TestNG and Junit, I did the assertion using the own Java and Selenium Methods for better understanding.
3. The program it's running on Java 1.8
4. If you have some question or better code opinion, you can send me a request, I would appreciate it
5. The application runs in Maven, so don't forget to build!
